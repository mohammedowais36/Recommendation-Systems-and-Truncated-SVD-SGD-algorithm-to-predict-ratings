# Recommendation-Systems-and-Truncated-SVD-SGD-algorithm-to-predict-ratings
Recommendation System is a class of machine learning algorithms used by developers to predict the users' choices and offer relevant suggestions to users. This project involves in 2 tasks. In Task-1, the rating for a given (user_id, movie_id) pair is predicted. And in Task-2, As we know U is the learned matrix of user vectors, with its i-th row as the vector ui for user i. Each row of U can be seen as a "feature vector" for a particular user. The question we'd like to investigate is this: do our computed per-user features that are optimized for predicting movie ratings contain anything to do with gender?
